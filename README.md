# SQL Workshop Assignments – Newton School (2025)

This repository contains my personal solutions to the 4-day SQL workshop hosted by Newton School.

## Contents

- **Day 1:** SQL Basics – SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY  
- **Day 2:** Joins and Filtering  
- **Day 3:** Aggregation and GROUP BY  
- **Day 4:** CTEs and Advanced Queries  

Each day contains:
- The original problem statement (as I remember or rephrased)
- My solution written in SQL

## Why This Repo?

Though the certificate required a payment, I chose to build this public portfolio instead. It showcases my real skills in SQL through practical problems and query design.

---

## Topics Covered

- Basic SQL Queries  
- Filtering and Sorting  
- SQL Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)  
- GROUP BY and Aggregate Functions

## Tools Used

- SQL (PostgreSQL-style syntax)  
- Termux (Linux on Android)  
- Vim Code Editor  
- Git & GitHub

## How to Run

To test these queries, you can use:

- [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/)  
- [SQL Fiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/)  
- Local setup using PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite  

**Note:** Make sure to create the tables and insert sample data before running the queries.

### Setting Up Sample Data for each Day

To run the queries for each Day, first create the tables and insert sample data:

```sql
-- Run schema.sql to create tables
\i Day_Basics/schema.sql

-- Run sample_data.sql to insert sample records
\i Day_Basics/sample_data.sql
